andrea_split: splits and training as in paper 
10Fold_sigmoid_V0 (old name: 10Fold_sigmoid): 10 stratifed (with outcome mrs > 2 or mrs <= 2) Folds trained with the last layer beeing activated with sigmoid (5 ensembles per split)
10Fold_softmax_V0: same Folds as 10Fold_sigmoid but last layer activated with softmax (5 ensembles per split)
10Fold_softmax_V1: new 10 Fold stratified (with mrs) and last layer activated with softmax (10 ensembles per split)
10Fold_sigmoid_V1: same Folds as 10Fold_softmax_V1 and last layer activated with sigmoid (10 ensembles per split)
